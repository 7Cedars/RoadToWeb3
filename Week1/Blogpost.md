Hi everyone, 

Here is my first submission for the Road to Web3. I’ve really enjoyed this first week’s challenge and am looking forward to the completing the rest in the next two months or so. 

I will follow the questions as posted on alchemy’s discord channel to structure my reflections. 

1) Who are you, and what is your software development background?

So this is Teije - I’m from the Netherlands but have been living in England for the last five years. I have a background in the social sciences and have worked with R and Python - but never as the main part of my academic work. 

I decided to go into the solidity and blockchain community about two months ago, and have been learning since. I had no knowledge of solidity (or react/javascript) whatsoever before then.  

2 )Why did you want to complete this lesson?

First of all, I decided to start alchemy’s Road to Web3 to strengthen my knowledge of solidity. I do have some knowledge of solidity by now, but thought it was best to start at the beginning of the track. 

But a second reason is actually about community. I am starting to realise how much of learning solidity is actually also about becoming part of an online community. The personal challenge is that I find online interactions a lot more challenging (and uncomfortable…) than offline ones. 

One of the best things about the lesson is actually this submission process: it is a great push to engage with the community. It was really great to read all the stories of people that are in a similar position and it makes it so much easier to start to engage. 

3) When did you complete the project?

October 31st. 

4) What technologies did you use?

The Open Zeppelin Smart Contract wizard and Remix. I used Inkscape to draw myself an NFT :) 

5) What did you enjoy about the tutorial?

The use of a wizard to create standardised (but still editable) smart contracts was an eye opener. It’s super easy to use, supports best practices and is a safe way to start building contracts. I will definitely use the Open Zeppelin (the wizard or their Github repository) constantly from now onward. 

6) How do you think you can use this technology to build useful applications in the future? What are some specific example applications?

Very similar to how it was used in this  

7) Who would you recommend this project to?

8) What is the Ethereum wallet address you would like to receive your PoK at?

 

This is a first test edit for an article on mirror.xyz.

- Contract Address / etherscan link - OpenSea/Rarible/other NFT link - a screenshot of your deployed NFT (e.g. in OpenSea) - (nice to have) Contract code attached or Contract verified (to verify the challenge) Remember, week-1 challenge is:

Next step? Why don’t you modify your smart contract to allow users to only mint only up to a certain number of NFTs? 5 per user should be enough, or someone might start minting thousand
